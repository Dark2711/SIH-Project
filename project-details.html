        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The Real-Time Traffic Management System is a cutting-edge computer
          vision project designed to enhance traffic management through
          real-time vehicle detection and tracking. By leveraging YOLOv3 (You
          Only Look Once version 3) and OpenCV, this system provides critical
          traffic management capabilities, including:
